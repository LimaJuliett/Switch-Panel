# Soldering Disclaimer for those new to the art
This is not an easy soldering project for a beginner. I’d been soldering for about a year before this project and this was a difficult project for me (which explaines why it looks so messy). Soldering is not easy at first and will take practice. I’m not even remotely qualified to teach to you solder, so I can’t take responsibility for your molten lead/burning flux. Learning to solder and doing it properly/safely is your job. That said, there are many good resources out there (the internet is a wonderful thing sometimes), so don’t be discouraged off this project if you don't know how to solder yet. Practice, perseverance, and patience are all you need. And for the solder ninjas out there, feel free to show me up. ;)
